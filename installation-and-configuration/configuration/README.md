# Configuration

All configuration options are declared in a yaml file named `sugar_config.yml`. This yaml file will hold information such as where your dbt projects live as well as high-level dbt-sugar behavioural configs such as whether you want to exclude some dbt models from dbt-sugar's scope, whether you want to homonegise definitons accros your models etc. 

Check the [Sugar Config](sugar-config.md) section to see how to set it up as well as to find out the exhaustive list of configuration options you can set up.
