## What is dbt-sugar?

dbt-sugar is a command-line interface tool that allows users of [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) to perform tasks such as **adding column and model documentation, enforce test coverage and tags \(more to come\)** directly from the CLI across a variety of dbt projects. Check out the [project roadmap ](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)if you want to know what is coming!

### Overview of Current Features

#### Documentation Task

* document a model's description
* document columns of a model \(and propagate description across fields that are identically named, we call this "homogeneise" and it is the main reason behind why we built dbt-sugar,
* add common `dbt` builtin tests such as `unique` or `not_null`,
* add tags
