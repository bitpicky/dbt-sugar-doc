## What is dbt-sugar?

dbt-sugar is a command line interface tool that allows users of [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) to perform tasks such as **adding column and model documentation** and **test enforcement** a little bit more fun and safely.

**Development of a MVP version is currently underway** and happening on [bitpicky/dbt-sugar](https://github.com/bitpicky/dbt-sugar). **We absolutely would welcome any help from feature requests, discussion in issues, help with database connector testing etc.**
